					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we are being asked to use user inputted data and use it to carry out a task on our websites.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For me, an issue that arose was consfuing the differnt varible names. It was a pretty expected mistake where while I was reading the instructions I confused the context of where that piece of code was supposed to go. I also tried to use my own code for the sorting function and I just ended up consfuing myself. But again I was able to figure out my issues!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I really find the concept of using user-inputted data really facinating. I really want to explore this more in the future!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here are my results!</p>

					<input type="text" id="user-name" placeholder="Input your name">
					<div id="output"></div>
					<button id="submit">Submit</button>
