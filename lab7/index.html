			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we will be stepping into the world of Functions. We will need to create a function that takes an inputted sting and then storts that and then returns it back into a string.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This again wasn't too bad to get the hang of, but that is thanks to the very helpful and detailed instructions provided for the assignment. A problem I did run in to was that I forgot to call the variables in needed but instead I called the same variable 'userName' thinking I was updating that one variable through the split, sort, and join. I quickly figured out what was wrong but it was an easy fix.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I really liked this lab because I feel like we're really starting to get into things. Being able to get user input makes me very excited about the possibilities that come with being able to collect that data. (not in a corrupt Big Tech corperation way)</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>These are the results of my lab!:</p>
