			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we are attempting what we learned about AJAX and APIs and implementing them into our lab.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For me an issue that occurred was I wasn't able to get the image that was part of my API to disply on to my webpage. Maybe it's because it's a GIF and not an IMG but luckily it displays 'yes' or 'no', randomly. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was completely different from anything we've done before with is always fun to figure out. Can't wait to learn more.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here are my results!:</p>
