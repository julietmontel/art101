			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we are asked to use conditionals in Javascript to use a user's name and sort them into a Hogwarts House from the Harry Potter world.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem I had was one of my own fault. It was going fine at first, it looked just like the professor's example but for some reason the function was completely broken and could not attempt to even try to run. I was so confused for so long I tried everything, and then I saw it, I spelt the word 'function' wrong. It was such an easy fix that it was annoying.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a really fun lab for me. It felt like a step foward from the things we have been doing so I feel like I'm learning and growing with this lab. I really like logic stuff so conditionals are always fun!</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here are my results: </p>
