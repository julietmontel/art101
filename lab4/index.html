			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we must pseudocode together to pre-code a game of our choosing. We have to creat a highlevel list of the actions of the game. Then we have separate the highlevel problems into subproblems. From there we will be able to add this to a JavaScript file, as comments.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For us there weren't really any issues, luckily. Similarly to the lab before this, it was a pretty straightfoward assignment. For me personally the formatting was not what I expected when it came to the "pre code" tag, it was pretty literal in terms of it's alignment. After a few tries I got it to look the way I wanted.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Pseudocoding for this lab was something that was very helpful. I can understand why it's an staple practice while working with code. I feel like it also really promotes the teamwork aspect of paired programming. But overall this was a parctice that is very useful and helpful when it come to planning code and will definitly create for a more efficent time doing the real code part! </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the pseudocode we came up with!</p>
					<pre><code>
//Outline:
//User input
//  Rock or Paper or Scissors
//Computer chooses 
//  Random
//Countdown
//  3 seconds
//Determine winner/loser of round
//  Win:
//    Rock > Scissors
//    Paper > Rock
//    Scissors > Paper
//  Lose:
//    any other combintion
//Add points
//Best of 3 games
//  end after 3 games
//  if tie keep going till winners
//Output winner

					</pre></code>
