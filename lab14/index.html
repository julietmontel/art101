			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we are being asked to go through our past labs that use JavaScript and debug them. We will be using the strategies and tools we learned in class to do this debugging.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not that this a problem, but I found it hard to find a bug in my code. That makes it sound as if my code is 100% perfect, it's absolutely is not, but when I turn in my labs I make sure they work before I actually turn them. So all my JavaScript seemingly works. The only lab that is super iffy is lab 13, </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p> Here are my results: </p>
