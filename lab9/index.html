			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries & jQuery</h1>
			<div id="challenge" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we are being asked to work and implement jQuery into our JavaSript. We are learning how to change our webpages and add intereactive bits and pieces using jQuery.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problem" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I think the main problem I got while doing this lab was just simply getting the code to work. It took a lot of trial and error to get it to work, but eventually I got it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was very interesting to work on. For some reason this lab felt like it was at a way different level than other labs. I think it might have been because of the lab extenstion but it just felt differnt from the same routine. But regardless, making a lot of mistakes just goes to show how much a person will learn while solving those mistakes and I feel like that is what I experanced during this lab.</p>
