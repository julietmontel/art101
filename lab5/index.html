					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab a part and I will be working together to make our first attepts at working JavaScript code. We will work with variables and data types.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab was pretty understandable to both my partner and me. Luckily we didn't have any issues!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I've had experience with the programming language Python and I feel like this part of JS is pretty similar to Python's version of declaring variables so I was able to get the hang of it pretty fast. </p>
			</div>
