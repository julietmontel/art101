					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, with a partner, we have to implement what we learned about arrays and objects to hold information about our options of transportation and our main mode of transportation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't experiance any problem. Once again this was a concept that we were able to grasp pretty well!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think that this was a very understandable process. I don't think I'll be able to understand the full power or ability of arrays/objects until we starting working on our projects, potentially, but I can really see how these concepts will be very helpful when storing data. Especially after lab 5, I also feel like we're definitely starting to get more comfortable with the JS environment.</p>
