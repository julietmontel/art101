					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we have been asked to create a function to generate random text and then use that function within another function that outputs the restults on the website. We will be using jQuery and we are also experiments with DOM manipulation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I think the biggest problem for me was realizing that the instructions were asking me to create a fucntion and not just individual lines of code. I had to take a step back and think about what I was doing and then understand the context. Luckily I realized pretty fast!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a very interesting lab for me. I really like seeing how much we've progressed since the first couple labs. It makes me excited to learn more!</p>
