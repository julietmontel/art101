			<h1>Lab 16 - JSON & APIs</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we are being asked to experiment with processing JSON from APIs. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For me personally, this concept is difficult for me to grasp, so implementing it on my own and understanding the context of the lab was also a struggle for me in general. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was very interesting. For me conceptually this is a difficult topic for me to understand, this lab fortunatly helped me understand it better. Specifically the 'recipe' in the lab was very helpful for me to see how this lab was supposed to look in terms of code.</p>
